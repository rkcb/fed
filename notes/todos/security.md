   - Add an authentication logic for Player 
   - Player must have roles
   - Only certain roles can edit db repositories
   - Only certain roles see certain web pages
   
   So urls must be classfied in sec config 
   
   - Add a logic to give a player roles; can this be done repositories?
   - Try add a custom repository method
   
# Done 

   - found that you can add JdbcUserDetailsManager in the configuration 
   - this manager likely can be used to create new users
   - Run tests to see what happens
